						What is technology really? The term technology is derived from the
						ancient Greek words “techne” and “logos”, which translates to “art,
						craft” and “word, speech” respectively. The term was used for the
						first time in the 17th century, and it was denoted to mean “a
						discussion of the applied arts”. Due to rapid advancement of
						technology it is more than it used to be.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Technology is everywhere around us. We use technology everyday to
						make our work easier and faster. In my life as well, I use a lot of
						technologies and for different purpose. As a student I use different
						technologies like smart phones, computers, televisions, gaming
						consoles, bikes and many more

						<p>
							As a student, technology like computers,smart phones, watches has
							been a crucial part of my life. Without them I cannot move on with
							my day. As a student my primary focus is education and without
							these technologies, I cannot get my education.Computers help me do
							my homeworks,research on different topics for my school work,
							check my emails and many more. Since the pandemic, it has been
							more important than ever. All the classes have been taught
							digitally so without computer I would have a tough time doing my
							school work. Similary smart phones help me achieve the same goals
							as well.It also helps me do my research, connect and interact with
							my friends and teachers. I also wear watch everyday to make sure I
							am always on time wherever I go.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							Furthermore, I use technologies like televisions, gaming consoles
							for my entertain- ment purposes. I enjoy watching tv shows and
							movies in television and I also have fun playing games with my
							friends which is all technology. Studying and doing school work
							can make us tired and exhaust so using these technologies I can
							get a break from my studies and can enjoy some time. Using of
							these technologies can make a person be addicted to them and
							wasting a lot of time.So i always make sure to use these
							technologies responsibly.I also use technologies like refrigerator
							to store my foods and washing machine to wash my clothes. For
							travelling purposes I use my bike to go places that I have to be
							in which saves a lot of my time and it is the easiest
							transportation medium in my opinion.

						<p>
							To conclude, I would say that technologies have been an important
							part of my life.The amount of time it saves and how it makes my
							work easier; it has a huge impact in my life. The benefits I get
							from technologies as a student and as a human is tremendous.
